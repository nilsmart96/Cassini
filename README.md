We are here to tell you the real impact companies are having. Claims of 
decreasing pollution or being net zero can be confirmed or falsefied using
our technology. No production facility can hide from satellites. And there
is even more to come...

The first variable we are monitoring are NO2 Values at the production 
locations of corporates. These gases are a by-product of any combustion 
of fossil fuels and are therefore also a component of the exhaust gases. 
The data is aggregated by a novel scalable framework of satellite data 
collection and processing. The Sentinel 5P program from copernicus serves 
as our data source for NO2.

Today we can present to you a proof-of-concept containing 7 locations that 
are characterised by heavy pollution. 

We plan to majorly extend the scope of our approach by including polluters 
of any size around the globe in the near future. On top of that we plan on 
increasing the monitored varibles by including further satellite data (Other 
Gases, Waste, Water Contmination, Ground Water Levels etc.), but also Social 
and Governance factors by doing sentiment analysis of company news and logging 
law suits.
