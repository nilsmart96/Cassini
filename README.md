We are here to tell you what companies are really polluting. Claims of 
decreasing pollution or being net zero can be confirmed or falsefied using
our technology. No production facility can hide from satellites.

It works by monitoring NO2 Values at the production locations of corporates.
This is achieved using a novel framework of satellite data collection and 
processing. The Sentinel 5P program from copernicus serves as our major 
date source.

Today we can present to you a proof-of-concept containing 7 locations that 
are characterised by heavy pollution. We plan to majorly extend the scope 
of our approuch by including polluters of any size around the globe.
