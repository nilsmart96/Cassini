We are here to tell you the real impact companies are having over the environment. Claims of 
decreasing pollution or having net zero environmental impact can be confirmed or falsified using
our technology. No production facility can hide from satellites. Moreover, the scope of our technology extends beyond this for sure...

The first of the many components we monitor are NO2 Values at the production 
locations of corporates. These gases are a by-product of any combustion 
of fossil fuels and are therefore also a component of the exhaust gases. 
The data is aggregated by a novel scalable framework of satellite data 
collection and processing. The Sentinel 5P program from Copernicus serves 
as our data source for NO2.

We present to you a proof-of-concept for 8 industrial geographical coordinates that 
are characterised by heavy pollution. 

We plan to majorly extend the scope of our approach by including polluters 
of any size around the globe in the near future. On top of that we plan on 
increasing the monitored varibles by including further satellite data - other 
effluents, land waste, water contamination, ground water levels etc.)
